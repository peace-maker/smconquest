This is a rewrite of L.Duke's Metamod:Source plugin Conquest in SourcePawn.

This game modification removes the ordinary bombing/rescue objectives and adds flags at preset positions to the map. A player can conquer a flag by standing near to it. The team which controls all flags first wins the round.
Some flags require more than one player near to it to get conquered.
